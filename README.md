# BIM Sign Bank by MFD
Bahasa Isyarat Malaysia (BIM) is the official [Malaysian Sign Language](https://www.mymfdeaf.org/bahasa-isyarat-malaysia-bim), recognized by the Persons with Disabilities Act 2008 in Malaysia. The [Malaysia Federation of The Deaf (MFD)](https://www.mymfdeaf.org/), a national organization that offers helps and services to the Deaf community in Malaysia, has played a crucial role in the development of BIM since 1997.<br>

In order to educate and promote the use of BIM, MFD intended to develop a BIM Sign Bank application to provide the official source of reference on the digital platform. As a non-profit organization, MFD needs a simple, sustainable and self-maintainable solution for the Deaf Community in Malaysia, as well as the students, teachers, parents and the general public in the digital age.<br>

As a "Friend of MFD" and in the spirit of social responsibility, the employees of [Guidewire Software](https://careers.guidewire.com/guidewire-gives-back) have stepped in and volunteered their time to help MFD to develop a simple and easy to maintain web application, and to host it on a sustainable and cost effective platform at [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for long run.<br>
